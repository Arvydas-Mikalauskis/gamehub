GameHub

The first project that I ever build, designed in figma, ant on later modules build with HTML and CSS. The requirements for website was;

The target audience of people between 18-25 years old who would like to purchase games or sell them. 

<strong>The site architecture; </strong>
<ul>
  <li>List of games</li>
  <li>A games page showing the product details (product details such as the description of the product, price and add to cart button)</li>
  <li>Checkout page</li>
  <li>Checkout success</li>
  <li>About</li>
  <li>Contact</li>
</ul>


On later modules site been implemented with call from API to display games list, and single game with description.
